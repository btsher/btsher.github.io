              Critical thinking has been a skill I've developed continuously throughout my academic journey. As an undergraduate, I absorbed cybersecurity concepts and techniques. However, my postgraduate studies have pushed me to think critically about these concepts, dissecting them to understand not just what to do but why we do it. This skill has evolved from merely following procedures to questioning and analyzing security practices and solutions. In the workplace, this ability to think critically will enable me to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures, adapt to new challenges, and contribute innovative solutions.
            </p>

            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>
              Effective communication is another skill that has undergone significant growth during my postgraduate studies. While my undergraduate education provided a solid technical foundation, my postgraduate coursework required me to convey complex cybersecurity concepts and research findings clearly and concisely, both in writing and verbally. This skill is vital in the workplace, where the ability to communicate technical information to both technical and non-technical stakeholders is crucial. It facilitates collaboration, ensures that security concerns are understood and addressed, and contributes to a culture of security awareness within organizations.

          <h2>Ethical Conduct</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            One of the key ethical considerations during my placement involved the proper use of data and the use of AI, specifically ChatGPT. This experience highlighted the importance of responsible data handling and the potential implications of AI misuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of my placement, I had access to a significant amount of data for analysis, including user behavior logs and system performance metrics. This data was critical for understanding the university's network and identifying potential security threats. Additionally, I had access to AI tools like ChatGPT, which could assist in generating security reports and recommendations.

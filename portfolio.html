          <h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            During my enriching placement experience, I had the privilege of working alongside the proficient Digital Trust Cyber Security team at Griffith University. I concentrated primarily on researching and identifying Kerberoasting attacks within the university network, harnessing the impressive capabilities of both Splunk and BloodHound. This journey encompassed a multitude of tasks, each contributing to my growth as a cybersecurity professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial steps involved delving into the world of Kerberoasting attacks. This required extensive research to comprehend the nuances of this sophisticated threat channel. I embarked on a journey to gain a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory and Kerberos, foundational components in this context. This knowledge formed the bedrock upon which I built my expertise.  
          </p>
          <p>
            A pivotal part of my role was mastering Splunk, a powerful tool for security analysis. I dedicated myself to learning its intricacies, ultimately becoming proficient in developing custom search queries tailored to detect Kerberoasting attacks. This practical experience solidified my theoretical knowledge, bridging the gap between academia and the real world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I had the opportunity to utilize BloodHound, an incredible tool for in-depth analysis of Active Directory permissions, potential attack paths, and vulnerable service principals. This provided me with a holistic view of our network's security posture, enabling us to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the technical aspects, I actively engaged with the cybersecurity team, actively participating in regular team meetings and check-in sessions. This collaboration not only enhanced my technical skills but also honed my ability to communicate effectively within a professional cybersecurity environment. I found myself solving complex problems independently, further nurturing my problem-solving acumen.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most valuable lessons I gleaned from this placement was the significance of being an active member of the cybersecurity community. The senior members of the team often shared how their community involvement yielded invaluable insights. This revelation underscored the importance of staying connected, not only for learning from peers and mentors but also for staying abreast of the ever-evolving security landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my opinion, this work placement has been profoundly enriching and instrumental in my professional development. It allowed me to concretely apply my academic knowledge to real-world scenarios, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Actively contributing to the security of a reputable organization, tackling critical issues like Kerberoasting attacks, and harnessing cutting-edge tools like BloodHound has greatly influenced my career aspirations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building upon these invaluable experiences, I have devised a comprehensive plan to continue my growth as a cybersecurity professional. My primary objective is to apply the expertise I've gained during this placement to my future career. Cybersecurity has beyond doubt become my chosen path, and the hands-on experience in researching and detecting Kerberoasting attacks has solidified my unwavering commitment. I aspire to pursue roles that align with this passion, consistently expanding my skill set and contributing to the security of organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the dynamic nature of the cybersecurity field, I am resolute in my pursuit of continuous learning. To remain at the vanguard of this ever-evolving landscape, I intend to actively participate in cybersecurity communities, attend conferences, and enroll in specialized training programs. These endeavors will not only keep my skills razor-sharp but also enable me to share my knowledge with others, fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge exchange within the cybersecurity community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the skills I've cultivated, particularly in using BloodHound and Splunk for analysis, are universally applicable and will be highly valued by all cybersecurity teams. Effective communication and meticulous documentation, which I've honed during this placement, are indispensable in solving complex problems and making informed decisions. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in any IT role I undertake, ensuring I contribute effectively to any professional context I find myself in.
